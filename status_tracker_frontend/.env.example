# Example environment variables for the Angular frontend

# Base URL for backend API (used by orchestrator to inject into window.__APP_API_BASE_URL__)
# For local development, you may rely on the Angular proxy (src/environments uses '/api'),
# which proxies to http://localhost:3001 per proxy.conf.json. For deployment, set this to
# the absolute backend URL, e.g. https://api.example.com
FRONTEND_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
